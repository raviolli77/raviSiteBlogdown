      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started programming I started to get the hang of &lt;code&gt;for-loops&lt;/code&gt; and I basically applied them to everything that was iterable. Upon learning more about efficient coding for data science, I learned about vectorization (mostly through R and pySpark), so I wanted to showcase a simple case study as to when vectorization reigns supreme over &lt;code&gt;for-loops&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, I decided that website creation wasn&amp;rsquo;t my cup of tea, so finding a purpose to build and maintain a website (besides putting on resume) was my first step in this site&amp;rsquo;s creation.&lt;/p&gt;
